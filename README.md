# Recycled-pen-plotter-using-DVD
A recycled pen plotter using stepmotors from recycled DVD, a servo motor and a suite of hardware/softwares from the OpenSource community : Arduino, GRBL-Servo, UniversalGCodeSender ,  J Tech Photonics Inkscape Laser Plug-In , LinuxMint, EasyDriver pilot. What's my contribution - for now to have found all the bits to make it works as of 2021, an original design for the pencil holder/plater and some nice documentation in french/english as it is intented to be used as an activity in Quebec schools.
